This is my first project for my Full Stack JavaScript Tech Degree. This is a random quote generator. With the click of a button, it will reveal a new, randomly generated quote on the page.

This uses a function to that randomly selects an object from the array and another function that takes the random object and displays it when the button is clicked.

Extra Credit
- I added an array of colors that change randomly when the quotes change
- I displayed additional properties with a few of the objects
- I added my own additional properties to some of the objects that display with those quotes
- The quotes change automatically every 3 seconds
